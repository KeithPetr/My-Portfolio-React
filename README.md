# My Portfolio

The project is creating my own portfolio website from scratch. the idea is to just keep a simple layout that 
showcases the skills and knowledge I have and directs the visitor to the portfolio section where they can 
view mys skills in action. I wanted to create the site using React to help further improve my skills using this 
library. I have also added React Router as a way to navigate between the different pages on my site.

## Project Details

I initially wanted to use a template for my site, but decided that creating a simple layout from scratch
was something I was very capabale of and would prove very helpful in improving my skills. It also allows me
better freedom of adding design changes in the future. I wanted to practice my React Router skills so I decdied
to add that to my site. I created a ProjectInfo file that contains an array of objects. Each object contains
all of the project's details and an id number. The reason I set up this file was so I could create 1 component
for a project card and a project page, import the data array, and then loop over the array to automatically
add each separate project's data. When I need to update a project's info, I can add it to the file and the
changes are applied.

## This project includes the following 'stretch goals':
  - Responsive design for mobile devices
  - Creating a 'hamburger' menu for mobile screens
  - Using React Router and params to navigate between project pages
  - Creating a netlify.toml file to allow browser refresh 

## Future Goals
  - Changing the design to a more modern and stylish look while maintaining simple navigation
  - Adding video explanations of each project
